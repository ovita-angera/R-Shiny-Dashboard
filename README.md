# R-Shiny-Dashboard
This is a dashboard project that implements an ELO rating system on the UFC MMA dataset obtained from `kaggle` at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata].
The projects involves cleaning up the data to a required format, which then is used in collaboration with a predescribed elo package in r to do the ELO rating system
and develop a probability system for the UFC MMA fighters. This system gives the win probability for each contender and does so considering the weight class and results
obtained by the elo model fitted to the tidy data.
This project gets inspiration from Andrew Couch's Tidy Tuesday analyses and R Shiny implementation of the UFC MMA data. The specific youtube videos I interacted with are:
