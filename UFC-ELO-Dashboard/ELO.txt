ELO rating system:
This is a system method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero sum games.
Zero sum games include games such as chess. This system is suitable for combat sports ranking such 
as the Mixed Martial Arts, Taekwondo and Jiu Jitsu combat games. 
This system was developed in the 1960s as a primary rating system for solely chess tournaments.
However, over the years, different sports have adopted the system and tweaked it in a way or another
to suit their sports systems without distorting the fundamental blueprint. These sports include
National Football League for American football and National Basketball Association for basketball 
tournaments.
The system is interestingly named after its developer `Arpad Elo`

The fundamental formula of ELO rating system gives the expected result of a battle, be it of wits
or a brawn, as a function of the rating difference of the two fighters. For instance given two 
contenders A and B:

Probability A beats B = 1 / (1 + 10 ^ [(ELO rating of B - ELO rating of A) / 400])

This formula bears a close connection to the logistic formula with a small difference where this 
formula uses 10 for the base, whereas the logistic formula use Euler's Number (e).
When plotted, this formula outputs a smooth sigmoid function for the probability function which 
resembles an S.

In the case of a tournament, a players ELO must be updated afterwards. The formula used to update
the ELO is given as follows:

New ELO of player A = Old ELO of player A + K {(r - Probability A breats opponent)}

where r = 1 if A wins, r = 0 if A loses and 0.5 Otherwise
      K is a scaling factor that calculates how fast ratings change.
